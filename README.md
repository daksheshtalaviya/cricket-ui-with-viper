# Cricket UI

## Overview

Cricket UI is an iOS application designed to provide cricket enthusiasts with a user-friendly interface to access cricket match information. The app offers two main features: `Matches List` and `Scoreboard` allowing users to browse cricket matches and view detailed scoreboards for selected matches.

## Features

- **Matches List**
  - Filter matches by Start/End Date: Users can filter the list of cricket matches based on their start and end dates, making it convenient to find specific matches.

- **Scoreboard**
  - View detailed match scoreboards: Users can select a cricket match from the list to view its detailed scoreboard, including batting and bowling statistics, total score, and other relevant match information.

- **Light/Dark Mode**
  - Cricket UI supports both light and dark modes, allowing users to choose their preferred theme for the app.

## Design Pattern

Cricket UI follows the VIPER (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router) design pattern, which ensures a modular and scalable architecture for the application. This separation of concerns allows for easier maintenance and testing of individual components.

## Technologies Used

- **Combine Framework**
  - The Combine framework is used for handling network requests in a reactive and efficient manner. It allows for the seamless integration of asynchronous data streams and error handling.

- **Codable Model**
  - The Codable model is utilized for parsing the API's response, converting JSON data into Swift objects and providing a structured representation of the match data.
